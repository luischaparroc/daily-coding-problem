Given a staircase with a number of stairs (N), calculates the total number of ways with an allowed steps.
The default allowed steps are: `{1, 2}`.

Function signature: `number_ways_optimized(n: int, allowed_steps: Set = {1, 2})`

Example:

```
number_ways_optimized(0) = 1

number_ways_optimized(1) = 1

number_ways_optimized(4) = 5
```
